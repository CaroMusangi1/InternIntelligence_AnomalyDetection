# InternIntelligence_AnomalyDetection
🔍 Anomaly Detection Using Isolation Forest
📌 Overview
This project builds an anomaly detection system using Isolation Forest, a popular unsupervised algorithm for identifying outliers in high-dimensional datasets.

⚙️ Key Features
Synthetic dataset with imbalanced data to simulate real-world anomaly detection.

Standardized preprocessing using StandardScaler.

Isolation Forest model from scikit-learn.

Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

A deployment-like function to flag anomalies in new data.

🧪 Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

Numpy & Pandas

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Google Colab (for interactive development)

🚀 How to Run
Open the code in Google Colab.

Run each cell sequentially.

Use the detect_anomalies() function to test new data samples.

📈 Sample Output
Confusion matrix visualization

Classification report with F1, Precision, Recall

Anomaly detection results on new sample data

💡 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
Use a real-world dataset like the Credit Card Fraud Dataset from Kaggle.

Try other models like One-Class SVM or Autoencoders.

Build a simple Streamlit dashboard to visualize anomaly reports
